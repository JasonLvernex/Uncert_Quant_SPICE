## Overview

This repository provides code for **Uncertainty Quantification in SPICE Reconstruction of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI)**. It uses the Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the voxel-wise uncertainty and bias in metabolite concentration estimates derived from spectral fitting of SPICE-reconstructed MRSI data.
